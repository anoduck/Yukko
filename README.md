Yukko
=====


Yukko is an ASCIIpunk NNTPchan client written in Python 3. Place a list 
of nodes seperated by new lines in nodeList.txt and the client will cycle 
through them at random. nntp.py is the library I have written for this 
project, it has been intentionally written in such a way that it does not 
depend on anything in the rest of the program, this allows it 
to be pulled out and used for other projects. To start it run `./yukko.py`
